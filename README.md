# Tadpole

This is a project that I used to tryout the cloudflare stack with honojs. This project uses honojs, prisma, d1, kv and workers as tech stack, and is a very simple crud app.

Include the bindings given in the worker-configuration.d.ts in your wrangler.toml file

```
npm install
```

```
npm run dev
```

```
npm deploy
```
